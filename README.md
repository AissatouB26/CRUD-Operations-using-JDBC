# CRUD-Operations-using-JDBC
A simple java program that uses JDBC to do CRUD operations on a PGAdmin database

--Setting Up the Application--
You will need to set up a PostgresSQL database to use it with. Once you create the database, use the query in the sql folder to
set up the initial data.
Then, navigate to the PostgreSWLJDBCConnection.java class. At the top, you will likely have to update the values in the URL, USER, and PASSWORD fields to work
for your database. Once that is done, you should be ready to run.

--Running the Application--
Make sure you have the java extension in VSCode. Navigate to Main.java and just click the run button for it to work.
